The reason that all these different pose estimates exist is because there are many different circumstances under which you may be using your robot. If you don't have a map, and don't want to build one, you should use /robot_pose_ekf/odom. If you don't have a map, but would like to build one as part of your application, you should use the map->odom tf frame provided by gmapping. If you already have a map and would like to localize your robot in it, you should use amcl_pose.
